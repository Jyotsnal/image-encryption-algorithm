# image-encryption-algorithm
This repository contains two Python codes: one for encrypting and one for decrypting images using a common key. The method applies block-wise permutation and modular arithmetic shuffling, as proposed in the paper "Enhanced Image Security through Block Permutation and Modular Arithmetic Shuffling" (submitted to The Visual Computer journal).
