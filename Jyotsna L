# 🔐 Image Encryption Project

This repository contains the full source code and sample data for the image encryption and decryption algorithm proposed in our paper.

📄 **Associated Paper**: *"Enhanced Image Security through Block Permutation and Modular Arithmetic Shuffling"*, currently **communicated in The Visual Computer** journal.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Google Colab (or Python 3.x)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Pillow (PIL)

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `encryption.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for encrypting an image
- `decryption.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for decrypting the encrypted image
- `sample_input/test_image.png` – Sample input image of dimensions (m₁=864, n₁=1152)
- `sample_output/test_encrypted_image.png` – Encrypted output using the sample key
- `sample_output/test_decrypted_image.png` – Decrypted image using the same key

---

## 🔑 Sample Key Parameters

For testing, the following key was used:

- Block size: **l = 4** → block dimension **L = 2⁴ = 16**
- Integer multiplier: **a = 13**
- Permutations:
  - α = (1, 2, 3, ..., 16)
  - β = (16, 15, ..., 1)

These values are applied identically in both the encryption and decryption notebooks to produce consistent results.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open either `encryption.ipynb` or `decryption.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload your test image when prompted.
3. Enter the key parameters (a, l, α, β) manually.
4. View and download the resulting encrypted/decrypted image.
